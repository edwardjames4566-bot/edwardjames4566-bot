    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Welcome! I'm a writer working in both fiction and nonfiction, though my focus right now is on fiction. I write about what interests me, and this site is where I share my work—offering excerpts, updates, and insights into the stories I'm crafting.</p>
    
    <p>My novel, <em>Skulls</em>, is a literary, occult-tinged techno-thriller about a small group of damaged people racing to stop a global act of psychic terrorism built into the architecture of the earth itself. When British researcher Julian is pulled into an investigation of an impossible acoustic signal, he and a fragile alliance of scientists, ex-intelligence operatives, and criminals uncover a hidden network of elongated skulls wired into ancient megalithic sites around the world.</p>
    
    <p>These "instruments" are slowly rewriting human perception, preparing for a coming eclipse that will allow a secretive cult to collapse individual minds into a single, inhuman will. As Julian, Lene, Alvin, and Mateo chase skulls and nodes from Sardinia to the Caucasus, Crimea, Lebanon, and beyond, they are forced to become exactly the kind of people the network is designed to erase—deciding how much of their own humanity they are willing to sacrifice to keep the rest of the world unfinished and free.</p>
    
    <p>Here you'll find excerpts from <em>Skulls</em>, updates on my ongoing projects, and links to read the complete novel.</p>

    <h2>Read Excerpts</h2>
    <div class="card-grid">
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Excerpt 1: The Discovery</h3>
            <p>Julian had never believed in ghosts. But some rooms outlasted their occupants.</p>
            <p>You could feel it. Something dense in the air, like a memory undecided about whether it should fade. The projector's whirr, the faint echo off stone walls, the smell of dry paper and cheap coffee. Everything conspired to pull you backward. Not to a place, but to a time. Back when things hadn't yet bent out of shape.</p>
            <p>Michael used to sit in the back. Always with his legs stretched too far into the aisle. Smirking like he knew something nobody else did. That smirk was more vivid than the smell of the room, which was saying something. Julian still caught himself looking for it.</p>
            <p>The projector clicked off. Silence swallowed the room.</p>
            <p>At the far end, he swiped his badge at the door marked Special Collections. The heavy lock thunked open. The air changed.</p>
            <p>Inside, the skulls were waiting.</p>
            <p>The skull on the table didn't belong in Exeter. Possibly not on Earth. It had no right to exist.</p>
            <p>"Not cradleboarding," Alvin said before Julian could ask. "No flattening. No parietal compression. No deformation trauma."</p>
            <p>Julian lifted it, turned it toward the light. The cranial vault was massive. Smooth. Elegant in a way that felt less like adaptation and more like blueprint.</p>
            <p>"Still transmitting," Alvin whispered.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Excerpt 2: The Reckoning</h3>
            <p>A silence roared inside him—a cacophony of thought without language, where his heroism and his massacre had become one and the same. He looked at Lene, serene and untouched, but the light itself seemed to bend around her, as if beauty itself recoiled away from him in disgust.</p>
            <p>They didn't speak on the way back.</p>
            <p>Later, in the van, she lay across the back seat, the mask still clinging to her face. Julian sat beside her, helmet removed, face wet. Mateo drove. One of the men up front said, "All of them dead. None tried to fight."</p>
            <p>Julian said nothing. He looked at his gloves. He thought of the mist. Of breath that no longer belonged to anyone.</p>
            <p>He thought, <em>I didn't kill them. I withdrew the world.</em></p>
            <p>Then Lene stirred. Her eyes focused.</p>
            <p>"You came," she whispered.</p>
            <p>Julian did not answer.</p>
            <p>Then: "Only part of me."</p>
            <p>And the van drove into morning, which looked exactly like night, except thinner.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Excerpt 3: The Apocryphon</h3>
            <p>"In the beginning there was a world of light without form, and all minds moved as one. But from the error of the lesser god came matter, the great imprisonment. Flesh congealed around the light and made prisons of bone and blood. Thus the first discord was born—spirit sundered from itself, scattered into countless isolated minds, trapped in clay vessels."</p>
            <p>Julian's heart pounded. <em>Matter as imprisonment.</em></p>
            <p>Lene met his gaze and whispered, "She's speaking of the Gnostic fall—the physical world as a prison."</p>
            <p>He continued, his voice softer now:</p>
            <p>"In ancient days, the faithful ancients received the message and re-shaped themselves as living instruments. Behold—their very skulls grew long like the crowns of angels, bone drawn out to attune to the whisper from beyond. Through these elongated crania, the first ones heard the Hum of the Infinite. They became amplifiers of consciousness, resonant keys that could unlock the minds of others."</p>
            <p>Alvin exchanged a look with her, realization dawning in his eyes.</p>
            <p>"They engineered themselves to receive something," he muttered under his breath.</p>
            <p>The room held its breath. The implication was impossible. And undeniable.</p>
